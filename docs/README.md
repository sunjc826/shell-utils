# BashTab

## About

**BashTab** is a comprehensive scripting framework designed to make Bash development more productive and maintainable. It provides a complete toolkit for building command-line applications with modern features like intelligent autocompletion, argument parsing, and seamless IDE integration.

### Core Strengths

**🔧 Language Server Integration**  
Works seamlessly with Bash language server for Go-To definition, code completion, and intelligent suggestions.
When sourcing a library script from your code, the language server will see all the defined function and variable symbols.

**⚙️ Unified Argument Handling**  
Argument parsing, autocompletion generation, and variable binding are tightly coupled in a single place, keeping your code DRY and maintainable.

**📝 Flexible Argument Parsing**  
Supports multiple argument styles:
- Positional arguments (`bu_parse_positional`)
- Keyword arguments (`bu_parse_multiselect`)
- Subparsers (`bu_parse_nested`)
- Recursive calls into other commands (`bu_parse_command_context`)

**⚡ Intelligent Autocompletion**
- **Lazy**: High-performance completion generation
- **Instant**: No compilation phase—modify your script and see completion suggestions update immediately
- **Accurate**: Script parsing and autocompletion work together for precise suggestions
- **Flexible**: Run any Bash command to generate completions, supporting even complex custom rules

**🔒 Safety**  
C++ RAII-like state management using a scope stack ensures correct resource handling and prevents common scripting errors like forgetting cleanups.

**🚀 Performance-Optimized**  
- Minimizes process forking in hot paths
- Custom `source` implementation prevents unnecessary script re-sourcing

**🎯 Everything is a Script**  
Even built-in commands are just scripts. The framework is fully extensible—commands like [bu-import-environment.sh][bu-import-environment] and [bu-get-command.sh][bu-get-command] are generated by [bu-new-command.sh][bu-new-command] itself, demonstrating the power of staying within pure Bash.
In fact, the "progenitor" [bu-new-command.sh][bu-new-command] is itself a script of a similar structure.

### Additional Features

- **Rich library functions** with `bu_` prefix for common scripting tasks
- **Server environment support** with automatic VSCode CLI linking
- **Powerful key bindings** including fzf-based autocompletion (Ctrl-X, Ctrl-Space)


When comparing against other Bash frameworks, it does *not*
- Convert a non-Bash DSL script specification like YAML into a Bash script parser. We stay ~100% in Bash-land.
- Provide a package manager: I.e. no special `import`/`load` function or command. There is however, a single `BU_MODULE_PATH` variable.

### Quick start

1. Activate the environment

```sh
# From the repository root
source ./bu_entrypoint.sh

# Or use the lightweight helper
source ./activate
```

2. Run the core CLI

```sh
bu
# or, if you set a custom name, use that instead (see below)
```

Customize the CLI name

```sh
BU_USER_DEFINED_CLI_COMMAND_NAME=my-cli-name
source ./bu_entrypoint.sh
```

This registers `my-cli-name` as the primary command; `bu` remains available for scripting convenience.

Tips
- **List commands:** run `bu` to see available commands and their short descriptions.
- **Command help:** run `bu <command> --help` for usage details and available options.
- **Autocompletion / IDE integration:** source the entrypoint in interactive shells to enable completion and to expose symbols to language servers.
- **Commands location:** see the `commands/` directory for built-in command scripts and examples.
